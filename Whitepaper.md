<center><b>Abstract.</b> Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) relies on a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) which issues and signs digital certificates for use in secure digital information exchange.  The CA is trusted not only to secure the root keys which sign the certificates, but also have a system in place to verify both the identity, trustworthiness, and security of the clients to whom it issues certificates.  Historically, this centralized approach is expensive and time-consuming to create and maintain, and relatively slow to report and fix potential compromises of trust.

We are proposing a new decentralized approach to PKI that utilizes public blockchain cryptocurrency to secure the private keys by assigning them monetary value.
